2. Your data is stored in local storage, so it persists even if the page is refreshed.
3. View the latest added products first.
4. Filter products by category and sort them in ascending or descending order by name (A-Z) or price.
5. Search for products by name and category.
6. Paginate through multiple pages of products and navigate via the navbar links.
